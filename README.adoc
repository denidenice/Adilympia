= AR Workbench Client

React client written in TypeScript (based on https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app[create-react-app]).

== Installing

`npm install` downloads all necessary dependencies.

== Running / Developing

`npm start` compiles and runs the application, spawning a server which reloads the pages as you develop.

== Testing

`npm test` runs all tests.

== Releasing

* `git tag v1.2.3` creates a release tag
* `npm run build` creates an optimized production build
* Copy `build` folder to test server (TODO: Where exactly?)
* `git push --tags`
* Update `version` property in `package.json` to prepare for next release
* Update issues/milestones/board on GitLab

== QA

=== Formatting

This project uses https://github.com/typicode/husky[husky] to format all code via a git commit hook.
To force a commit in defiance of the hook, use `git commit --no-verify`.
